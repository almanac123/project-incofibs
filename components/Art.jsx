                InCoFIBS, an international conference organized by the
                department of Life Science, NIT Rourkela every five years,
                addresses the advances made in the various fields of Biological
                Sciences. The conference aims to provide a global platform for
                exchanging ideas and works by multiple scientists, researchers,
                and international experts. It also offers a rostrum for young
                researchers to showcase and share their ideas with peers working
                in their field. These advances and efforts have unleashed many
                global players on the platform, bringing to the fore exciting
                and equally enthralling technologies that have led to the
                emergence of specializations and interdisciplinary fields.

                Research is in a unique position to confront uncertainty. The
                dire grievances brought on by Covid-19 and the climate crisis
                demand more than utopic gestures or hopeful technologies.
                Challenged by the tensions of our times, Researchers are tasked
                with applying diverse forms of embodied knowledge to craft new
                tools for post-crisis conviviality and radical kindness. We are
                seeking future-oriented responses to current social, cultural,
                ecological and economic challenges through the manifold means of
                high-level practice and reflection. The conference proposes
                three attractors to advance understanding of new directions of
                research and stimulate new collaborative capacities and
                interdisciplinary scholarship.

                The 3rd International Conference on Frontiers in Biological
                Sciences (InCoFIBS-2023) will savor the respective
                potentialities of digital and physical modes of co-presence,
                manifesting in two different modes: A 40minute lecture hour
                “long conversation” online offering a variety of successive
                presentations throughout different time zones, and a three-day
                gathering, providing the opportunity for focused sessions,
                exchange and brainstorming sessions in physical presence. For
                the “long conversation”, presenters are asked to moderate the
                discussion of the speaker immediately following their own,
                interweaving call and response elements of presenting. For the
                physical presence part of the conference, researchers of all
                disciplines are invited to meet and collaborate in sessions and
                posters during lunch time and other scheduled time within a
                spatially decentralized, socially-distanced and
